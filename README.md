# COVID-19 Data Analysis Using Python

## Project Overview

**Project Title**: COVID-19 Data Analysis using Python  
**Dataset**: `covid19_data.csv`

## Objectives

1. **Load the Dataset**: Import and preprocess COVID-19 data using Pandas.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Identify and handle missing values, incorrect data types, and outliers.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform data exploration to uncover patterns and trends.
4. **Statistical Analysis**: Compute key metrics like infection rate, recovery rate, and mortality rate.
5. **Data Visualization**: Generate charts and graphs using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.

## Project Structure

1. **Data Loading & Preprocessing**: Use Pandas to read, clean, and preprocess the dataset.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze trends in COVID-19 cases, recoveries, and Deaths.
3. **Statistical Analysis**: Calculate key COVID-19 metrics such as daily and cumulative cases.
4. **Data Visualization**: Create visual representations of trends, geographical spread, and fatality rates.
5. **Summary & Reporting**: Provide insights and actionable conclusions.

## Findings

- **Case Trends**: The data shows fluctuations in daily cases, recoveries, and deaths over time.
- **Geographical Insights**: Certain regions have higher infection rates compared to others.
- **Mortality & Recovery Rates**: The analysis provides a breakdown of fatality and recovery percentages.
- **Lockdown Impact**: Identifies the effectiveness of restrictions in controlling case numbers.

## Reports & Visualizations

- **Daily & Cumulative Trends**: Line charts showcasing the progression of COVID-19 over time.
- **Regional Analysis**: Bar charts displaying case distribution by country or region.
- **Mortality vs. Recovery**: Pie charts and statistical summaries of fatality and recovery percentages.


## Conclusion

This project provides a **comprehensive data-driven analysis** of COVID-19 using Python. By leveraging **Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**, it uncovers key insights that help understand the spread, recovery patterns, and impact of interventions. The findings can assist policymakers and healthcare professionals in decision-making.
